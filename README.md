This is just a collection of tools that I have found useful in my 
own work with julia.  They are completely untested and I don't consider
this to be a "real" julia package.  I'm keeping this code on github mainly
for my own convenience.  Of course anyone is welcome to use it if they
find it useful.

I may create real packages for some of this code in the future if it continues 
to prove useful and there is any outside interest.
